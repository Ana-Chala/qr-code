## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I have learned:how to insert image in html;

```html
<img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR CODE IMAGE"width="288"heigh="288" >
```
 box-sizing property,that allows us to include border and padding in element's total width and height;
```css
*{
box-sizing: border-box;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to get better at padding and be more precise in next projects.

### Useful resources
